        description %(

# Background

This test group verifies that the client can access Condition data
conforming to the US Quality Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis.

# Testing Methodology

## Data Access Supported

Clients may not be required to support the Condition FHIR resource type. However, if they
do support it, they must support the US Quality Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis and the resource type's search parameters.
The tests in this group will not execute if client makes no attempt to access data for the
Condition resource type. In this case, the test will be marked as skip if support
for the resource type is required, and omitted otherwise.

## Reading
This test will check that the client performed a read of the following id:

* `us-quality-core-test-kit-condition-encounter-diagnosis`

## Searching
These tests will check that the client performed searches against the
Condition resource type with the following required parameters:

* patient + category
* patient

Inferno will also look for searches using the following optional parameters:

* patient + abatement-date
* patient + code
* patient + onset-date
